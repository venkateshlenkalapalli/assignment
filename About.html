                Something that I have wanted to do for a long time is take a look at the web’s best About Us pages.Why? Because a good About Us page is very hard to come by.Normally they are a boring, self-serving mix of me me me and us us us. But a they are so vital to your business. In fact, its usually the first place people look before they start to take you seriously. Get it wrong and you could be turning people off without even knowing it.
